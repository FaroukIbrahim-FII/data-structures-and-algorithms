# Hashtables

In computing, a hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Challenge

An implementation for a hashtable with its functions.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach of classes and methods were used.

Big O:

* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

## API

* add: has the key, add teh key and value pair to the table.
* get: gets the value that is associated with a key in the table.
* contains: returns true if the key exists in the table and false if not.
* hash: gives the index in which the key has to be added along with the value.
