# Singly Linked List

A task to add more methods to the linked list.

## Challenge

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

    append
        arguments: new value
        adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
    insert before
        arguments: value, new value
        adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
    insert after
        arguments: value, new value
        adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach of classes and methods were emplemented in the task.

Big O = O(n)
