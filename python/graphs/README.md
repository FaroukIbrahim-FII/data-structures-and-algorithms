# Graphs

In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics.

## Challenge

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

* add node
* add edge
* get nodes
* get neighbors
* size

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach of using classes and methods were used

Big O:

* add node:
    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(n)

* add edge:
    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(1)

* get nodes:
    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(1)

* get neighbors:
    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(1)

* size:
    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(1)

## API

* add node: adds a node to the graph
* add edge: adds a connection to the node
* get nodes: gets all the nodes in the graph as a collection
* get neighbors: gets a collection of edges connected to the given node
* size: returns the total number of nodes in the graph
